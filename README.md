## 🔄 Model Flexibility

This application currently uses the **Ollama Chat Model** for answering questions, but the architecture is **model-agnostic**. You can swap in other LLMs like:

- **OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-3.5**
- **Anthropic Claude**
- **Mistral**
- **Google Gemini**

Model differences (e.g., context length, token limits, inference cost) will affect the performance and pricing — choose the one that fits your use case.
